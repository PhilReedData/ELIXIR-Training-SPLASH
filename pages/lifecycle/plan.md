## What is Training Plan?

The PLAN stage in the training life cycle involves identifying and assessing training needs to outline the logistics and pedagogy of the training considering the target audience, setting clear goals and objectives. This stage also includes allocation of funding and resources as well as infrastructure needed to deliver the training. It is also in this phase that retro-planning should be drafted for efficient time management.

Consider if the training will be part of a curriculum, a learning path or isolated. If it should be included in a learning path or curriculum, decide on how it would be articulated. If it is needed, in this stage, we will need to define how to select trainee candidates: how their expertise will be assessed, when, and criteria to select.

By carefully planning these aspects, organisations can ensure that their training initiatives are relevant and aligned with the overall learning and development goals.

## What are the logistical aspects?

* **Budgeting and Resource Allocation**: Determine the financial resources required and available for the training. Consider potential funding sources and establish a clear budget plan.
* **Trainer selection**: Identifying qualified trainers within the community and establishing a training team that can include hired trainers or not, appoint a course leader if needed. 
* **Trainer recruitment**:  Recruitment processes to hire new trainers when applicable. 
* **Size of training team for one training**: Might vary according e.g. to the number of participants, format of training, audience level, etc. Ideally a minimum of two trainers are available per training for good support and backup for unforeseen events.
* **Training format and delivery**: Selecting the most appropriate format (e.g., classroom, online, blended) and delivery method and training schedule (e.g.: duration, spread of lessons, time of offering) according to level, audience availability and topic.
* **Preliminary logistical arrangements**: Planning for venue, equipment, and other available general resources for participants during the training session (e.g. restaurantes, meeting rooms, break rooms, etc …) that might have  logistical requirements in order to establish budget etc. 
* **Marketing and promotion**: Developing or integrating to already existing  communication strategies to attract and inform potential participants.
* **Code of Conduct**: Establish a code of conduct for training events to adhere to
* **Evaluate**: Developing or reusing already existing strategies to l evaluate the training and include that in your plan.

## What are the pedagogical aspects?

TODO: address some comments in the gdoc

- Training needs analysis: Identifying specific training gaps. Assessing pedagogical, technical and logistical requirements.
- Target audience: Defining the specific group of individuals who will benefit from the training.
- Learning objectives: Clearly outlining the desired overarching outcomes of the training.
- Curriculum development: Creating a detailed training curriculum that aligns with learning objectives.
- Learning paths: Review related learning paths and determine if and how this training aligns with them. 
- Train the Trainer : Continuously offer training for your trainers.

TODO: does ELIXIR have anything for identification of training needs (survey?)?

## Related roles:

- Stakeholder/institutions: identify training needs
- Coordinator/Admin: logistics, communication, evaluation & assessment of the quality of a course, prepare forms
- Organiser: organise the training and work in direct relation with the trainers
- Trainer(Instructor): delivers the training.
