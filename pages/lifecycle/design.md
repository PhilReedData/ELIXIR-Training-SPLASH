## What is Training Design?

This is the creative stage of the training lifecycle. At this point you will use your training plan to detail and make a concrete lesson plan (written outline, script of the individual lessons) and the syllabus for the students. Keep in mind that this is an iterative phase, you might want to update your Plan and your Design a few times before it is robust.

To guide you in this process you can consult and get inspired by the ELIXIR GOBLET Train-the-trainer (TtT) and Learning paths resources. In the TtT you  can find inspiration for many steps of the training lifecycle to design your lesson. With the Learning paths you will be guided through the process of creating a ordered set of lessons/materials. Access TeSS to find reusable materials and get even more inspired in your adventure.

## What are the pedagogical aspects?

When designing a training course, one should consider the Nicholls’ paradigm for curriculum development, more specifically:

- define the learning outcomes (LOs) based on the topics you have defined in your lesson plan. For writing down the specific LOs, you utilise the Bloom taxonomy that will help you specify KSA (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities) that learners are able to demonstrate after the Deliver stage. This allow creating tangible evidence that learners have achieved during the learning process.
- define the learning experience which is any setting like lectures, games, acitivities, ... in which learning takes place. Each LOs should be related to at least one learning experience.
