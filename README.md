# SPLASH
The ELIXIR Training SPLASH has been designed to guide the trainer in their efforts to plan, design, develop, deliver and evaluate training activties. It is based on the various steps of the training life cycle, although not all the steps will be relevant to everyone.

The contents are generated and maintained by the ELIXIR Training platform ELIXIR-TrP. We want to sustain and govern ELIXIR Training SPLASH via the ELIXIR Programme 2024+.

SPLASH is short for

    Skills,
    Professional development,
    Learning Assessment,
    Support and
    Help

along the training life cycle.
